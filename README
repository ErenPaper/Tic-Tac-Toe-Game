# Tic-Tac-Toe Project by Raphael Ramos

Included Files :
* TicTacToe.cpp
* Makefile
* README
* PlayGame

Running Instructions :

Change the directory of the command prompt into the 'Tic-Tac-Toe-Project', which contains all the files included. To run the game,
simply type in the command prompt 'make run', and the game will run in your terminal.


Notes and Assumptions :

PRESS ENTER every turn you have to confirm your turn. If you have inputted an invalid number, > 9 or < 0, PRESS ENTER after the prompt prints 'INVALID MOVE!' to
continue playing.

When finished with the game, PRESS ENTER to receive an additional prompt that asks if you want to play again. Press 'y' or 'n' to either execute the program
or continue playing the game.

    - make: Runs and updates the file PlayGame by running the compiler built into the makefile (g++)
    - make run: Runs the game program inside the terminal by executing the commands './PlayGame'
    - make clean: Removes all object files and executables and runs the commands 'rm -f PlayGame *.o'
    - make help : Prints a list of targets and the purpose of each.
